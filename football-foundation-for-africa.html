    <div class="project-brief">
        <h3> Brief </h3>
        <p>The Football Foundation For Africa (FFA) is an international social enterprise that seeks to drive investment
            in grassroots development in Africa with the ultimate goal of creating jobs for the youth. FFA has come a
            long way from organizing local football tournaments within communities in Nairobi-Kenya to having
            international partnerships across Africa.</p>
        <p>With this growth came the challenge of brand communication. How can the FFA visually get known across
            Africa? The founder, Brian Wesaala, reached out to Zedafrica do develop the web platform. Zedafrica then
            collaborated with Viisualworks to help develop the website and handle all graphic designs</p>

    <div class="project-approach">
        <h3> Approach </h3>
        <p>We had a few back and forth conversations trying to understand the vision of Mr.Wesaala. Before any mockup
            was created, we had to know which platfrom the site would be under. We chose Wordpress cause of itâ€™s ease
            of use for us and the client. Then we came up with the brand identity. From colors to font to voice to
            pictures.
            All these were critical to know in order to position the FFA in the African football ecosystem</p>
        <p>After discovering those, we created mockups. Some were rejected, some were accepted. We then proceeded
            to code the accepted designs</p>

        <h3> Graphic Services </h3>
        <p>However, the website was not enough. Mr Brian still had more projects in store and we were tasked with
            creating a consistent visual identity for all FFA ventures from partnership announcements, FFA project
            announcements to most notably, The Africa Football Business Show- an online web series that engages football
            stakeholders in matters grassroots and international football
            All these were critical to know in order to position the FFA in the African football ecosystem</p>
        <p>Sample designs are shown below. More can be seen <a
